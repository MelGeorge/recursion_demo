# Recursion Demo
This is a live coding demo for EECS 280 students to demonstrate writing basic linear recursive, tail recursive, and tree recursive functions.

## Usage
### Compile with:

g++ recursion.cpp -o recursion.exe

### Test each function individually by running exactly one of:

./recursion.exe summation

./recursion.exe summation_tail

./recursion.exe fibonacci
